  <h2>List of Cities Penrod Wants to Visit</h2>
  <dd>Growing up in the 90's, I was a huge fan on Steve Irwin and have always wanted to visit Sydney. I have always had an avid interest in the unknown, to include cryptids and little green men, so that explains New Mexico. After graduating High School I fell into the realm of TTRPG's and board games that weren't Life, Scrabble, or Monopoly. Essen Germany is home to the largest gaming convention in the world.</dd>
